## **What is an Engineering Coach?**

At Help Scout, we call anyone who manages people a "Coach". Therefore, an "Engineering Coach" is someone who manages people in the Engineering department.

## **How Does and Engineering Coach Handle Communication?** 

I'm an Engineering Coach at Help Scout, and I often get a number of questions about my role. The Engineering Coach role is similar to what most organizations call and Engineering Manager, but there are differences.

First of all, how much of your time would you say you spend communicating in real time with other team members, versus independent work and asynchronous communication? 

I'm aware that some of the engineering team are also in GMT-ish time zones, but it would be useful to know if I'd need to completely switch my work hours to match US time zone(s) or whether there would be valuable work to do when everyone else was asleep. Gut feeling is yes, there's always prep work and thinking to do, especially in a coaching role, but it's always best to check!

## **What Makes a Good Engineering Coach Candidate?**

TBD
