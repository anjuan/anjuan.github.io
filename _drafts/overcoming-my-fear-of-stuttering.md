I shared that I'm a stutterer in my Manager Usual Manual, and I've been afraid of my dysfluency for as long as I can remember. It was never chronic because I could often speak at length without stuttering. However, I would have random experiences where I would just get stuck and not be able to pronounce a word no matter how hard I tried. To add to the insult, I often struggled with words that start with short vowels, and my first name starts with a short vowel. So, I would sometimes not be able to complete the sentence, "Hi, my name is . . . "

To cope with my stutter, I developed a large vocabulary so that, if I felt I would stutter when saying a word, I would have a couple of "safe" backup words to use as substitutes. Of course, keeping a mental dictionary of these words added additional anxiety to everyday conversations. My stutter also made me very afraid of speaking on the phone because it seemed to be even worse when I couldn't see the person to whom I was talking. I can't tell you how much I loved the "Instant Messenger Era" (Yahoo Messenger, AIM, Google Messenger, IBM Sametime, etc.) because I could talk to people without having to speak!

My stutter made me fear talking so much that I sometimes considered getting out of software development and finding a career that didn't require talking. However, I enjoy regular meals so I stuck with coding.

I also love the spoken word, and I felt that I had things to say, especially to the technology industry. I could let my fear of speaking shackle me, or I could find some way to free my voice. So, I decided to face my fear head on. I began speaking at tech events in front of audiences. I put myself in situations where I had to find a way to get the words out.

I learned that deep rehearsal was the key for speaking clearly on stage so I started my practice of religiously going over what I was going to say. I've also recently adopted some light breath work that has helped a lot. I've gone on to speak in front of larger and larger audiences, and I've never gotten stuck on stage. I've been fortunate to get invited to keynote at large tech events with hundreds of people in the audience, and I'm so glad that I didn't let my fear hold me back.

I also LOVE talking with the the people I get to work with every day. Overcoming my fear of stuttering has resulted in some of the best conversations I've ever had about building software and life in general. I'm a better human because of the folks I've had the fortune to call colleagues.

I'll always be a stutterer, but I'll never let stuttering take away my voice.
