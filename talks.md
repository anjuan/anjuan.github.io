This page serves as a directory of the talks I give at tech events. Each link will take you to an individual page for each talk which includes the abstract, description, slides, videos, and feedback from attendees. If you would like to collaborate with me on a talk, [contact me](/contact/), and I'll be happy to discuss your idea with you. Also, I'm always open to sharing what I've learned about being a public speaker.
