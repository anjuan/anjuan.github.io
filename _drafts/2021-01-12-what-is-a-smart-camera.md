This is part of my Smart Home series where I explain the various internet connected devices you can use to get more out of the place you live.

## **What is a Smart Camera?**

A smart camera is a device that records pictures or videos and makes them available to be viewed over the internet.

## **Use Cases**

* You're away from home, and your partner calls you from home about something happening in front of your house.
* Someone doing work at your home breaks something but claims they didn't do it or the item was already broken.

## **Where Do I Put a Smart Camera?**

TBD
