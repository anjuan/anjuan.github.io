I've led software engineering teams since the 1990s starting with more than a decade at Accenture, the at Deloitte, a few bids at various startups, and now as a Staff Engineering Manager at GitHub. There are many practices I use as a manager, but one of my favorites is the 1:1.  This post includes my favorite 1:1 questions and techniques. But, first, let's start with the basics.

# Basics

## What is a 1:1?

A 1:1 (also called a "1-on-1", "one one one", or "one to one") is a regular meeting between a direct report ("direct") and their manager. As you may be able to tell from the name, it's meant to be one person (the direct report) engaging with one other person (the manager). The purpose of a 1:1 is to provide time for both people to share their perspectives, concerns, goals, and expectations.


## How Often Should I have a 1:1?

I'm a firm believer that 1:1s should be weekly. I think any other cadence is too long of a period between touchpoints. Weekly 1:1s let your directs know that they have dedicated time with you that is usually a few days away.

In addition to being a regularly scheduled weekly meeting, I also think that 1:1s should be at the same time each week. I usually try to have all of my 1:1s on the same day because that helps me deliver information to my directs at roughly the same time. I also find that the people I talk to earlier in the day often help me refine the message for those later in the day. I don't think this refinement would happen if my 1:1s were spread across two or more days.


## How Long Should a 1:1 Be?

I typically schedule my 1:1s for 30 minutes, but I'm always willing to have a follow up meeting if necessary. While I am not against hour long 1:1s, I've found that difficult to schedule unless the number of directs is less than five  

## What 1:1 Tools Should I Use?

There are a few tools that have been purpose built for 1:1s, but I usually just create a document, share it with my direct, and then add new entires to the top. This document becomes a living artifact of my relationship with each person I manage which I think is pretty cool.

I know that a direct has brought into the 1:1 concept when they add items to the agenda. That's a sign that they see the importance of our 1:1 meeting and want to contribute to it.

# My Favorite 1:1 Questions

Now that we've covered the basics, here are my favorite 1:1 questions. Keep in mind that I often have to discuss topics like company events, share observations about the team or my direct, provide context, etc., during my 1:1s so I rarely get a chance to just ask these questions during the meeting. However, I usually try to insert at least one question into the agenda.

The first weeks of working with a new direct are comprised of "establishing 1:1s" where I'm setting context, cadence, and starting to build trust. These are the first and second 1:1s and then two special "types" of 1:1s that I do each month: performance and relationship building. I then list the 1:1s in rough groupings based on the duration of the time I've spent with each direct. Ideally, trust builds as time goes on, and I can ask more intimate and impactful questions. Of course, these groups are rough approximations, and I ask the questions in whatever order aligns with the needs of the direct.

## **First 1:1**

I like the first 1:1 to be very informal. I usually don't have any agenda and check in on how their onboarding is going. The main outcome is to schedule our weekly 1:1. 

## **Second 1:1**

The second 1:1 is where I start to get more structured, and start the help my direct get to know me and, hopefully, encourage them to get to start opening up to me. I share the following information about me and then give them time to share the same.

* **Pronouns:** he/him/his
* **Location:** Houston, TX, USA
* **Hobbies:** Travel, Reading, Writing

I also usually share Julia Evans excellent writeup on a [brag documents](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/) because I think it's an excellent way to self-manage your career.

### **Performance 1:1s**

I use the first 1:1 of a new month as a "performance 1:1". We talk about the career expectations of the direct, and I usually pull up the career ladder and have the direct walk me through how they think they are doing. I do this whether the direct wants to get promoted at the next possible promotion period or if they don't feel any urgency about getting promoted. I think it's crucial to make performance management an ongoing conversation because, at the very least, the impact the direct is having will drive whatever rewards they receive from the company. Those rewards can include a promotion, but they will more frequently be increases to their base pay or, if offered by the organization,  a bonus or stock award.

If one of my directs is surprised by a promotion outcome or their rewards, then I've failed them as a manager. The monthly Performance 1:1s are ways for me to give the direct a data point about how I think they're doing. It's also an opportunity for me to discuss opportunities to discuss ways for them to improve their performance or find new areas to demonstrate impact.


### **Relationship Building 1:1s**

Within the first three months of working with a direct, I start asking relationship building questions on the last 1:1 of a month. These are meant to help me better understand the person (not just the role) I'm managing. I usually answer the question first to give them a sense of how to formulate their answer (and also signal that it's safe to share non-work interests).

I've sourced most of these questions (in this section and also this entire post) from Peoplebox's [Ultimate List of One on One Meeting Questions](https://www.peoplebox.ai/t/one-on-one-meeting-template-manager-questions-list). I also selected some from a set of "getting to know you" cards from a restaurant in Houston called [Daily Gather](https://www.dailygather.com/). Here are a list of my favorite relationship building questions (in the rough order I tend to ask them):

* **What books are you planning to read in the next 12 months?**

* **If you were to go back in the past and learn something you couldn't, what would it be?**
* **Describe one of your most memorable days.**
* **If you could wake up one morning with a new quality, what would it be?**
* **What signs should I look for to know that you're in a bad mood?**

* **What is one belief that has made you who you are today?**
* **What's something most people don't know about you?**
* **What have you gotten away with that you shouldn't have?**

## **First Three Months**

At this point, my directs have formed their initial impressions of me. However, those impressions may have been formed based on incomplete information or perhaps not during my best moments. These questions help me reset and recalibrate their perceptions and, ideally, know where I need to do a better job showing up for them. 

* **What tools and resources would hurt the most if you suddenly couldn't use or access them?**
* **What were your big or small wins in the past month?**
* **What is that one thing I can do to make you feel more recognized at work? Would you like that to be done publicly or privately?**
* **What aspect of your work is extremely exhausting and demanding?**

* **On a scale of 1-5, how happy are you at work? How can I make it better for you?**
* **What aspect of your role do you need more clarity on?**
* **What type of work environment brings out the best in you?**
* **Is the feedback I give you sufficient?**
* **Is there anything your past managers did that frustrate you?**
* **What changes can I bring in to our 1-on-1 meetings to make them better?**
* **What makes you feel helpless at work or prevents you from reaching your full potential?**
* **What is the one thing that's holding the team back from performing at its best?**
* **Which part of the day are you at your productive best?**
* **What specific training & development opportunities will help you in your career growth?**
* **What other skills do you have that you feel we are not fully utilizing?**
* **Whom would you like to have as your mentor?**
* **Who has done an incredible job on our team lately?**
* **Whom did you help perform better and succeed at work recently? How?**

## **After Six Months**

* **Are there any changes you want to make to the duration or frequency of our 1:1s?**

This helps me see the logistics of the 1:1 are working for the direct. 

* **Is there anything you like in particular about my management style?**
* **What would you want me to start doing as your manager?**
* **What would you want me to stop doing as your manager?**

At this point, the direct has a sense of my management style and probably also has confirmed what they like and don't like about. These questions provides an opportunity for the direct to give me vital feedback that I can use how I tailor their management experience to better align with how they want to be managed. However, some people like being managed I'm ways that don't match their weaknesses so I also get a chance to coach them. 

If the direct doesn't respond to these questions or responds with something like "Nothing.", then I know that I need to focus on building trust with this individual. 

* **What work routine helps you stay productive at work?**
* **Are you able to share any kind of feedback with me openly?**
* **What aspects of your work would you like me to direct you more in?**
* **Is there anything I can do to improve the performance of our team?**
* **Is there anything you would like me to clarify or re-explain to our team?**
* **What are the biggest time wasters for you each week/month/quarter/year?**
* **What's the most important thing in your career right now?**
* **Of the things you do on a daily basis, how much of it is aligned with your long-term goals?**
* **Do you have clarity on our company's strategy and how your role fits into it?**
* **Do you feel like youâ€™re growing in your role? What makes you say that?**
* **What are some of the goals you would like to achieve in the next quarter?**
* **Do you face difficulty in getting along with anyone in our team?**
* **What do you think about our teamâ€™s relationship with other teams?**
* **What is something about our company culture that impresses you the most at work every day?**

## **After First Year**

Ideally, after the first year, we've built a strong sense of shared trust. 

* **Have any of your future career goals changed since the last time we spoke about them?**
* **What can I do to build our team's reputation in the company?**
* **Can you think of an instance where I said or did something you didn't like or agree with?**
* **Do you have any worries related to your work, role or company? How can I help?**
* **Whatâ€™s stopping you from achieving your long term goals?**
* **How can the training programs you've attended be made better?**
* **How would you rate the level of loyalty our company shows to its employees?**
* How aligned are the members of the top leadership team with each other?**
* **Do you have clarity about the company level goals set by top leadership?**
* **What, according to you, is our company's biggest problem?**
* **What is one thing that we should definitely do to enhance our product?**
* **How are your personal values aligned with the company's mission and vision?**
* **What changes would you bring in if you were given the reins of this company?**


# 1:1s Should be a Perk

I've found that the way I structure my 1:1s resonates with the people I'm tasked with supporting and helping them make progress on their career journeys. Your directs should see 1:1s with you as a perk of the job and nearly as valuable as retirement plans, health insurance, and vacation time. If that's not the case, then these questions and the conversations they spark will upgrade the value your directs derive from spending weekly time with you.
