I've been lucky to work in the technology industry which pays quite a bit more than other industries. I've never really worried about money, but I know I haven't managed money as well as I should. Over most of my career, I would have rare but random overdraft fees where I spent more than the amount I had in my checking account simply because I wasn't watching my balance or forgot what day was payday.

I was like a lot of people in the American middle class. I didn't have an income problem. I had a cash flow problem.

A few years ago, I applied what I learned from agile software development to come up with a light weight system designed to simplify my spending. I call it lightweight budgeting.

## **The Lightweight Budgeting Values**

Since budget can be a draining term ("I get to work on my budget!" said no one ever), I call it a budget calendar. It's a simple way to control your spending and take control of your personal finance.

* Automation over memory and repetition
* Rough approximations over penny perfection
* Multiple Accounts over detailed accounting
* Consistency over everything

## **Assumptions**

* You don't have any credit card debt. If you do, then you should focus on zeroing that out. However, getting a budget calendar can help you do that.
* Whatever payroll system the organization that pays you uses allows you to deposit your pay to more than one account
* Your bank has some form of an online bill pay system that you use to automatically pay your bills. If you don't use this system, I recommend enrolling in it to automatically pay your bills.

One challenge with having a budget is keeping track of the various bills that take things out of your account. Most of your bills are taken out on the same time each month. So, the first step is creating a budget calendar is going through a few months of your checking account and see when each bill is deducted.

Getting a sense of the flow of your cash will help you get into the rhythm of your spending. You'll then be able to set the beat for how you want your money to work for you.

Go through your checking account statements and see when your fixed expenses go out. These are things like your mortgage/rent, car payment, utilities, etc. Add these to your calendar by putting the name of the vendor and the rough amount of the bill. If the bill isn't paid on the exact same time each month, then use a date range for it.

Adding these expenses to your calendar helps you not be surprised by a deduction.

## **An Account Centered Approach**

My lightweight budget approach heavily uses multiple accounts. I found that having one or two accounts made it difficult to have enough granularity into my cash flow.

Here are the accounts I use:

* Expenses
* Spending
* Target
* Emergency

> You can also go with the basic 50/30/20 budget, wherein youâ€™re spending no more than half your income on basic necessities and saving at least 20% of your income, leaving the remaining 30% to spend on the things you and your family enjoy.

How you allocate your net pay will vary based on your situation, but here's what I use:

* 10% - 401k
* 10% - Emergency (becomes a Target account above a threshold)
* 30% - Spending
* 50% - Expenses

Each account is at the same bank but separate. The Emergency and Expenses accounts have separate debit cards.

If your monthly expenses are more than 50% of your monthly income, then you probably need to find ways to ways to save money.

You can use additional accounts to get ore specific, like, "Boat" if you're saving for a boat. This is just what I use.

If you have access to a retirement account (e.g., 401k, then I highly recommend having your contributions to that account automatically done before your paycheck hits your bank. This is especially true if your employer offers a match.

One benefit of this approach is helping you think about future spending. If you want to buy something, you know how long it would take you to earn it back (in spending weeks).

This assumes that you don't have any credit card debt. If that's the case, I recommend paying that off.

* Enter your pay days
* Enter your recurring payments (should be the bulk of your expenses
* Notice the debits that occur before credits.
* Helps answer the question "How much should I spend on this optional expense?"
* Also helps answer the question "What's the impact of my required variable expenses on my cash flow?"

Take your allocation for spending and divide it by the average number of days between paychecks. That's your daily spending limit. At the beginning of each day, put that much into your wallet. I used to do this backward (put the entire amount in my wallet and then draw it down). But, daily adding it helps me be more disciplined.

You can also use your daily spending limit as a burn down chart. Divide the amount of spending money by the average number if days per pay period. This number represents the amount of money you would have in your spending account if you spent it evenly between paychecks. Find your next pay day, and enter the fully funded value for your spending account as an all day calendar event. For the day after pay day, subtract the daily amount from your spending account. Repeat for the rest of the pay period. This gives you a daily reminder of if you're above or below the target amount. I compare this number to the daily text I get from my bank of my current balance in my spending account. If you balance is way higher than your target amount, you can splurge on something you really want (as long as you don't go below your target). Maybe get that nice article of clothing, splurge on an expensive meal, or buy that gadget. Conversely, if your balance is way lower than your , then cut back. Maybe don't go out for drinks or stay home and read instead of going to the movies.  

You can simplify this by taking your monthly expenses and adding 10%. This is how much cash you need to cover your bills (with some buffer). These are things like rent/mortgage, groceries, utilities, transportation, etc. Set up your paycheck to automatically deposit this amount into a checking account called EXPENSES. Include how much you need per pay period in the name of the account.

What's left over after you fund your account for your living expenses is what you can use to spend on non-essential items and also for your emergency fund. Call your spending account SPENDING and the amount per pay period in the name of the account. This is for things like eating out at restaurants, coffee, electronics, etc.  Call your emergency account EMERGENCY and your target amount in the description. Your target amount should be some multiple of your monthly living expenses.

All of this should automatically be done when your paycheck is deposited. If you get income from different sources, you'll need to determine how to send money to each account.

After my paycheck is deposited according to my preset percentages, I take the amounts in SPENDING and EMERGENCY and round them up to the nearest $100 using the EXPENSES account. So, if I see $749.32 in SPENDING, I transfer $50.68 from EXPENSES to make it $800. I do the same thing for EMERGENCY. This is a little bump to help me feel that I'm taking some action on my accounts. I get a little gift to myself for spending and also one for my emergency savings.

As you use this system, you can adjust it. If your expenses change, you'll need to change your allocations. If you regularly (three times in a row) have more than 20% of your living expenses left in your EXPENSES account at the end of each pay period, you may want to decrease the flow of funds into that account and increase the amount you send to EMERGENCY or SPENDING.  Once you reach your emergency fund target, you can start putting less money into it (although I recommend continuing to put some money into it each pay period).
