excerpt: "The year 2023 had a lot of firsts for me. It was my first full year at GitHub, and it felt like the first year that was fully free of COVID's shadow. Here are my favorite photos, social media posts, and thoughts about each month in 2023."

I turned 49 years old this year, and I'm beginning to see the acceleration of time that many have told me happens as you get older. It seemed like I had just started getting ready for 2023 a few months ago, and it's already coming to an end. This posts captures the moments that stood out to me from January to December of this year.
