Hello! Most of the content on this site is about my career in technology, but, if you really want to know what I care about, look no further than my family. No matter whatever level of success I achieve, nothing will be more meaningful or significant to me than my family.

Another key thing to know about me is my belief in the power of communities. A community doesn't mean the absence of disagreement. On the contrary, a community is a place where people learn to work through their disagreements in order to achieve fair outcomes for everyone. This idea underlies a lot of the non-technical topics in my writings and in my talks.

While you've probably come to my site to learn more about me, I'd love to know more about you. Feel free to [contact me](/contact/), and I would enjoy getting to know you. I receive a lot of messages so I can't promise an immediate response, but I do read everything sent to me. We'll eventually connect.

One reason I moved my site to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) was my belief in the power of open source software (OSS). As an advocate, I felt it was important to run my own online space using OSS. You can view the source for this website on [GitHub](https://github.com/anjuan/anjuan.github.io). Feel free to fork and use it to build your own site. Pull requests are always welcome.
